# Runtime: backend service

Run design production from a service or pipeline, with no person watching.

## Choose a shape

| Shape | Who writes the design | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| Agent loop | An agent runs this skill in a container with a shell and file tools | Open briefs, where the layout is not known |
| Pipeline | Your code asks a model for `plan.json` and runs the scripts | Known templates and high volume |
| Packages | Your code calls `polotno-node`, `@polotno/schema`, and `@polotno/pptx-export` | You have your own pipeline |

A pipeline for a deck from a customer template:

```bash
node scripts/from-template.js template.json plan.json deck.json
node scripts/validate.js deck.json
node scripts/lint.js deck.json --brand template.json --target pptx
node scripts/render.js deck.json proof.png --strict
node scripts/render.js deck.json deck.pdf --vector
node scripts/render.js deck.json deck.pptx
```

Give the model the output of `from-template.js template.json --list`, and
`templates-brand.md` for the plan format.

## Set up the host

Install packages at build time, never during a request:

```dockerfile
FROM node:24-bookworm-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    ca-certificates libnss3 libnspr4 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libcups2 \
    libdrm2 libxkbcommon0 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxfixes3 libxrandr2 \
    libgbm1 libasound2 libpango-1.0-0 libcairo2 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY skills/polotno-design /app/polotno-design
WORKDIR /app/polotno-design
RUN node scripts/dependencies.js --all
ENV POLOTNO_DEPENDENCY_UPDATE=never POLOTNO_UNTRUSTED=1
```

`PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` before the install saves a Chrome download on Linux
x86-64, because polotno-node uses its own Chromium there.

- **Node:** 22.13 or later for vector PDF, 20.9 or later for the rest.
- **CPU:** the bundled Linux Chromium is x86-64. On arm64, install the `chromium`
  package and set `POLOTNO_BROWSER_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium`.
- **ffmpeg:** optional. MP4 works without it. With audio, install it so that the
  audio can become AAC. Without it, the audio stays Opus.
- **Fonts:** a slim image has no system fonts, so CJK, Thai, and Indic text needs
  a font for that script. Lint rule `font-script` reports this.
- **Read-only files:** the scripts keep working with the packages they shipped.
- **Parallel runs:** safe. Runs share one install through a lock.

## Set the environment

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POLOTNO_API_KEY` | Your key. A wrong key does not fail a render, so check it when you deploy |
| `POLOTNO_DEPENDENCY_UPDATE=never` | No npm activity at run time |
| `POLOTNO_UNTRUSTED=1` | Rejects `file:` sources and blocks private network requests. Set it for JSON that a model or a user wrote |
| `POLOTNO_BROWSER_PATH` | The Chromium binary, if the bundled one cannot run |

Also restrict outbound network access for the render process in the container or
firewall.

Production use of `polotno-node`, `@polotno/pptx-export`, and
`@polotno/pdf-export` requires a Polotno subscription. Each package has its terms
in `LICENSE.md`.

## Read the result

Each script prints one JSON report to stdout. npm and renderer messages go to
stderr.

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Done. Read `warnings` and `overflow` in the report |
| 1 | The design failed a check or a render. stdout (`errors`) or stderr (`error`) says why |
| 2 | Wrong usage. `validate.js` and `from-template.js` also use it for a missing install |
| 3 | `render.js --strict` wrote the files and measured an overflow |

| Failure | Cause and repair |
|---|---|
| `FONT_FAILED` | The font is not a Google font, or its `url` failed. See `templates-brand.md` |
| `IMAGE_FAILED` | An asset URL failed, after three attempts |
| `DESIGN_INVALID` | The JSON is invalid, or it has a `file:` source under `POLOTNO_UNTRUSTED=1` |
| `Failed to launch the browser process` | System libraries are missing, or the CPU is arm64. See the host setup |
| `npm dependencies are missing` | The build step did not run `dependencies.js --all` |
| `resolve-assets.js` exit 1 | The `dropped` list names each element that lost its image |

## Review without eyes

Visual proof needs a model that can view images. The scripts check structure,
fit, brand, and PowerPoint losses, but they cannot judge a layout.

- **Vision model available:** send `render.js deck.json sheet.png --sheet`, each
  page, and `proof-checks.md`. Repair from its `block` results.
- **No vision model:** pass the gates above, and mark the result as unreviewed.
  Route it to a person before it reaches a customer.

## Cloud Render API

If the host cannot run Chromium, the API renders the same JSON (paid key). It
makes png, jpeg, pdf, gif, and mp4. It has no PowerPoint output, and
`@polotno/pptx-export` needs no Chromium.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.polotno.com/api/renders?KEY=$POLOTNO_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"design": <design.json contents>, "format": "mp4"}'
# → {"id": "..."}
curl -s "https://api.polotno.com/api/renders/<id>?KEY=$POLOTNO_API_KEY"
# → {"status": "done", "output": "<url, valid 7 days>"}
```
